# JAVA-MongoDB

This is just a test application in JAVA with a MongoDB database.

1. The Insertion into the database workes perfectly.
2. Searching and other CRUD Operations will be updated soon.
	NOTE:
This was written in 2 hours just to check the functioning and so the indexing of code is not proper.
It will be resolved in the final commit.

If you face any problem importing the project, drop me an email at : rt912@snu.edu.in
